This is my first crack at blogging, I believe it is a great medium to keep all of my doings in one concise place!

##I had some help developing:

* I wanted to see how Googles new [Domains](domains.google.com) service worked, so I picked up a new one and ported over my old GitHub Pages site.
* Becuase I had this shiny new domain, I figured it was time to step into the modern world.
* I knew I wanted to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for a solid, easy to manage/view base.
* I then moved to making a theme...
 * after I messed around with that for a week or so, I found HPSTR (linked below)
 * HPSTR had everything that I was struggeling to add to my theme
 * It is easy to manage, and everything is there.
 * The owner also has a few other [Jekyll Themes](http://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/)
* I got everything just how I wanted in under a week, all said and done.
* And best yet...it supports both legacy browsers and all modern browsers!!
