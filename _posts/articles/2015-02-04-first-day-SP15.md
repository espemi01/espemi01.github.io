## The Way Here:

Well, we made it through the near blizzard, the 3 hour drive that took all of 4.5; it wasn't fun, but we did it. Anyway today marks the first day that I am no longer a Physics major, and now it is time to focus on Computer Science. I think that this semester will be great, I have a lot of fun classes that I am really interested in. This is the most excited I have been about the start of a semester in a long while.

## Classes:

* Intro To The New Testament -- Guy Nave

 * I knew the professor was going to swear, but I was not expecting a "s**t" in the first five min.

  * followed closely by a few f-bombs

   * and shortly there after, copious profanity...

 * I really like how the professor handles the reading reflections

  * They are not a fixed length, just until the student feels comfertable with the content.

 * I feel like I am really going to like this class!

* Programming Languages -- Kent Lee

 * Unfortunately, this class is entirely new material for everyone, so it is going s.l.o.w.

 * The first two homework assignments took under 10 min. each, not that I am complaing

  * Coming off of Physics homework (+2 hrs per assignment) it feels slightly out of place
  
 * Though it is starting overwhelmingly boring, I still believe I will learn a lot.
