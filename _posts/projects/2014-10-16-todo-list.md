This is the first Javascript project that I put together. It was assigned in my internet programming class (CS 252).

###Completed Goals

* Different priority levels
* Seperate classes/divisions
 * Have them mutable
* Color coded sections

###Additions I want to make
* Android app to match
* Due dates
* Reminders via email/SMS
